# Crowned Clothing

My first react application.

## Live version

https://crowned-shop.herokuapp.com/

## Techs

**React.JS**, **Redux**, **Firebase**, **Stripe Payments**, **Styled components**
There is a little nodejs server handling stripe payments but not much not consider.

## Clone this repository

You can clone this repository following a few steps:

- yarn install

- yarn dev

- enjoy !

## Disclamer

The nodejs server is meant to handle stripe backend payment, but the repository doesn't contain the secret key, as it is a secret key.
If you clone this repository you will receive a little message telling you that the payment is not successfull each time you attempt to checkout.
But if you want to check the right behavior you should definitely check out the live version.
